* If there is no wait list, we can have the empty slots bullet Point

**Instructions for you:**

Please **edit this `event_listing.md` file** (download it, edit it, then re-upload it to me). You can:
* Rearrange elements.
* Change bolding or other Markdown formatting.
* Add/remove lines.
* Suggest where the image should go (e.g., as the embed thumbnail, or a larger image).
* Add any other details you want to see.

Once you're happy with the desired formatting, upload the updated `event_listing.md` to me, and I'll work on adjusting the bot's output to match.
