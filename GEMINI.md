## Gemini Added Memories
- This project is a Python-based Discord bot.
- Its purpose is to connect to a Discord server, with a new feature to integrate with Warhorn for D&D sign-ups.
- Key technologies include Python, Discord.py, and the Warhorn GraphQL API.
- Warhorn API authentication uses `WARHORN_CLIENT_ID`, `WARHORN_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `WARHORN_APPLICATION_TOKEN` from environment variables.
- The project uses `pipenv` for virtualization and dependency management.
- The user's operating system is Windows (win32), and all shell commands should use cmd.exe syntax (e.g., `mkdir`, `dir`, `copy`, `move`, `del`, `type`, `echo %VAR%`, and backslashes for paths).
